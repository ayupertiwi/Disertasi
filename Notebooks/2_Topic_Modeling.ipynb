In the boost mode, two capacitorsare parallel charged and series discharged by the dual coupled inductors. Thus, high step-up voltage gain can be achieved with an appropriate duty ratio. In the buckmode, two capacitorsare series charged and parallel discharged by the dual coupled inductors. The bidirectional converter can have high step-down voltage gain.The stress voltage of all switchescan be reduced, and the switching loss and efficiency can be improved. The operating principle and the steadystate analyses of the voltage gain are discussed. Finally, in 24V for low voltage, and 400V for high voltage, and 200W for output power, this converter simulated in MATLAB.\",\n          \"In this paper, a new suggested system for speaker recognition by using hidden markov model (HHM) algorithm. Many researches have been written in this subject, especially by HMM. Arabic language is one of the difficult languages and the work with it is very little, also, the work has been done for text dependent system where HMM is very effective and the algorithm trained at the word level. One the problems in such systems is the noise, so we take it in consideration by adding additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) to the speech signals to see its effect. Here, we used HMM with new algorithm with one state, where two of these components, i.e. (\\u03c0 and A) are removed. This give extremely accelerates the training and testing stages of recognition speeds with lowest memory usage, as seen in the work. The results show an excellent outcome. 100% recognition rate for the tested data, about 91.6% recognition rate with AWGN noise.\",\n          \"Space cooling is required all year around in the tropics area especially Indonesia. To provide the space cooling requirement, the electricity cost and environment impact are important aspect that it must be considered. The household in the tropical area is real conditions require a cooling device and greatest potential to use alternative cooling. In fact, solar radiation over the roof surface can be thrown to the environmental by convection mechanism in order to the room can be remaining in comfortable condition. The experimental investigation was performed to two model of household. That is household without and using evaporator, respectively. Also in this reasearch, evaporator was placed in two location, over and or under surface of the roof. Water from underground thermal storage is used as a working fluid to pick up amount of heat over the roof and then rejected on thermal storage environment. The mesurement of experimental data was conducted start from 08.00 WIB to 17.00 WIB. Roof temperature will fluctuation with raise of time start from the morning to evening. The maximum temperature difference between household without and with evaporator are \\u00b1 12 0C with water mass flow rate 0.0125 kg/s and \\u00b1 8 0C with water mass flow rate 0.0187 kg/s for evaporator over and under the surface of the roof respectively. This research result have still uncomfortable condition for household. However, this research can be used as an initial step to build up a cooling system with low cost of electrical power and environmental friendly. Moreover, thermal reduction on the wall and the window to increase in the performance of this method are necessary. Then, the impromevent of roof geometry has to performed to keep the maximum interface area of heat transfer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
